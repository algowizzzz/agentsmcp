## Model Documentation Toolchain — Executive Brief

FileSystem Tool — Inventory & Delivery
- Walks only the folders that matter and finds code fast.
- Always leaves you with one final Markdown file in the path you choose.
- Expect short, predictable runs and no scanning of junk folders.
- You control which file types and folders to include or skip.

Code Parser Tool — Ground Truth Extraction
- Reads your code and builds a simple map: modules, classes, functions, and imports.
- That map becomes the facts the doc uses, so names and references stay correct.
- Expect fewer “this is wrong” comments in review and quicker sign‑off.
- Skips generated/third‑party code and hands clean structured data to the next steps.

LLM Summarization Tool — Architecture Narrative
- Turns many file summaries into one clear story of how the system works.
- Explains modules, data flow, control flow, patterns, and key assumptions in plain English.
- Expect faster alignment across teams and fewer clarification meetings.
- You can tune voice and mandatory callouts using prompts/templates.

Section Drafting Tool — Audience‑Ready Chapters
- Writes each chapter from your template (Overview, Methodology, Implementation, Results).
- Mixes the architecture story with code facts, so content is specific yet easy to read.
- Expect consistent, on‑brand chapters that need edits, not rewrites.
- You set tone, length, and emphasis (e.g., risks or metrics) in template prompts.

Document Assembler Tool — Single Source of Truth
- Stitches all chapters together, adds a table of contents and front‑matter.
- Produces one clean Markdown file you can share or convert to DOCX/PDF.
- Expect a single “source of truth” per model and version.
- You control section order, TOC depth, front‑matter fields, and output path.
